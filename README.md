# Pull-Together
Pull Together is  a 2D made in Unity 2D Game Engine. This is my first 2D project.

In this 2D game, you need to help reuniting two lost souls by navigating them through obstacles.

One directly follows you instructions and the second follows first's commands when movement lock is enabled.
